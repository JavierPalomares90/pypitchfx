# Pypitchfx
### Javier Palomares

During one of my grad school projects, I decided to train some AI/ML models related to baseball. In order to do this, I would need to collect any data that MLB makes available about the game scores, players, pitch by pitch results, and pitch data.
While researching this, I found that since 2007, MLB has tracked every pitch thrown in games using high speed cameras and MLB makes this data available through its Gameday website as xml files available at http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/ (Update: this portal will soon be depracated and replaced with an API. I am an updating this tool to use that API instead of the xml feed).
I searched for a few tools to get the data, and by far the best tool I found available was this [pitchf/x package.](https://pitchrx.cpsievert.me/)
Unfortunately, it's written for R, and hasn't been updated in a few years.

With that in mind, I decided to build my own python package available here.
This packages parses the  xml files into objects to simplify data interaction.


## Installing the package
The package is now uploaded on pypi. Install it using pip

```pip install pypitchfx```

## Parsing Data into Objects
The  data  available  at  MLBâ€™s  Gameday  portal  is  formatted  into  xml  files. There is 1 xml file per game `innings_all.xml`,  containing all of the innings,  half innings, at bats, and pitches occurring during the game formatted as xml elements in sequential order.  Within this file there is a `game` element composed of 9 `inning` child elements (or more if extra innings are needed to break a tie).  Each `inning` element has a `top` and `bottom` child element for each half inning when teams swap batting and fielding.  The`top` and `bottom` elements have `atbat` child elements for each batter appearance in the half inning. The child elements of the `atbat` element is the sequence of pitches in the at bat. Additionally, there is a `players.xml` file pergame containing the data for the players in the game.

The tool parses each of the xml elements into python objects for easier data manipulation.

Additionally, the tool generates unique identifiers at parse time to guarantee uniqueness and to relate parent and child elements.

## Getting data objects for a given data range
```
from pypitchfx.scrape import scrape_games_players
games,players=scrape_games_players(start='2013-06-01',end='2013-06-01')
```
## Writing to a database
Pass in a sqlalchemy engine and the script will write to a relational database
For example:
```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from pypitchfx.scrape import scrape_games_players

engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2:<user>:<pw>@localhost')
games,players=scrape_games_players(start='2013-06-01',end='2013-06-01',engine=engine)
```
